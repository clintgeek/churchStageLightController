# churchStageLightController
Light controller for 12v stage LED lighting.

### Purpose:
Our church's youth group is spectacular. They are highly involved and tremendously dedicated. Each month they decorate the main stage to Hollywood and/or Broadway standards. While the actual stage lights are managed by a professional DMX controller, we had no way of adding lights to props, structures, or other on-stage items. The goal of this project is to create a self-contained controller with a simple UI that can manage low voltage RGB LED lighting. A standardized output plug would allow the ability to adapt LED strings, strips, or bulbs for use with various on-stage lighting needs.
